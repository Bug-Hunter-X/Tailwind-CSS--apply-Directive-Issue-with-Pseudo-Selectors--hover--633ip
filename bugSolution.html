The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors like `:hover`. Applying the styles directly to the element is more reliable.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

This revised code applies the hover styles directly to the button element, resolving the issue.  The `@apply` directive should be used cautiously with pseudo-selectors due to this limitation.
