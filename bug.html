This bug occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `&:hover`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly expand the pseudo-selector styles in all cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded @apply hover:shadow-lg">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

The `hover:shadow-lg` won't work as expected because `@apply` doesn't properly apply hover styles within its scope.
